# Get TryHackeMe Account

TryHackMe [THM] is a very beginner friendly platform which is geared toward teaching you cyber security. This is the Platform we recommend using, which is also going to be used during the onboarding Event. Here is a quick overwiev on the principals of this website:
THM hosts intetntionally vulnrable Virtual Machines [VM], so called Rooms, which provide structured learing Expirience. There are differnt kind of rooms varying in how much help THM provides. 
First there are Walkthrough Rooms intent to teach new topics, they ocntian a lot of information and ask more comprehesive questions.
And second there are Challange(CTF) Rooms. In this type of Room have to find the the hidden secrets within the  and you are given no further information about this box, other than the IP-Address.
Sometimes those Chanllange Rooms are more guided than others if that is the case the phrasing of the question often provides some insight on how to continue.
