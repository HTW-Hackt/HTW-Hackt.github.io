title: "The Five Pillars of Cybersecurity Fundamentals"
---

[The five pillars of an infosec professional by DFIR Madness](https://dfirmadness.com/getting-into-infosec/the-five-pillars/) with some minor adaptations. 

## General Computing  
This pillar is about understanding the underlying principles of how computers work — both from a theoretical and a hardware perspective. It includes computational theory (e.g., complexity, algorithms, data structures), as well as the physical and architectural layers that make modern computing possible.

Developing a solid grasp of these fundamentals provides context for everything else in cybersecurity. It helps you reason about what’s happening under the hood when systems are attacked or defended.

## Coding and Programming  
This pillar is about understanding how software is built, how it behaves, and how it can break. That includes the practical ability to read and write code, automate tasks, and build tools — but also knowing how modern software systems are designed, deployed, and maintained. This knowledge is essential whether you're writing your own exploits, analyzing malware, or securing production applications.

In security, you're constantly navigating the boundary between code and infrastructure. By understanding how developers think — and how software behaves in real-world environments — you become far more effective at both offense and defense.

## Computer Networks  
This pillar centers on how devices communicate — both locally and across broader interconnected systems. It covers the foundational models and principles that govern the transmission of data, coordination between systems, and the behavior of distributed infrastructure.

A strong grasp of networking is essential in cybersecurity because so many risks and defenses emerge at the boundaries between systems. This is especially true in cloud environments, where virtualized networks, ephemeral resources, and abstracted infrastructure introduce new dynamics and attack surfaces. Understanding how data flows, where it can be intercepted, and how systems interact provides the necessary context for identifying vulnerabilities, implementing controls, and designing resilient architectures.

## Unix  
This pillar focuses on Unix-based operating systems — the architectural and philosophical foundation behind many of today’s most critical platforms, including Linux and macOS. It includes an understanding of system processes, user and permission models, shell environments, and how these systems are typically configured and used in practice.

In cybersecurity, Unix fluency is essential. These systems power much of the internet's infrastructure and underpin many security tools and research environments. Knowing how Unix systems operate enables defenders to investigate incidents, configure secure environments, and work efficiently in command-line-driven ecosystems.

## Windows  
This pillar covers the architecture and operational principles of Windows-based systems, which remain deeply embedded in enterprise environments worldwide. It includes understanding how the system manages users, processes, permissions, and authentication — as well as the broader ecosystem in which Windows operates, such as domain structures and cloud services.

Security work on Windows requires insight into how it behaves by default, how it's typically deployed, and where its common weaknesses lie. A strong foundation in Windows is essential for effective security operations in real-world environments.
